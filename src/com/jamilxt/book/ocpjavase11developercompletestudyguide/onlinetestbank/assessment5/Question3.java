    An underscore (_) can be placed in any numeric literal,
    so long as it is not at the beginning, the end, or next to a decimal point (.).
    Underscores can even be placed next to each other.
    For these reasons, options A, E, and F are correct.
    Options B and D are incorrect, as the underscore (_) is next to a decimal point (.).
    Options C and G are incorrect, because an underscore (_) cannot be placed at the beginning or end of the literal.
