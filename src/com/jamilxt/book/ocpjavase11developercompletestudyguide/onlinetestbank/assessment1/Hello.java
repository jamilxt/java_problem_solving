    /*
        The class compiles and runs without issue.
        Line 10 gives a compiler warning for not using generics but not a compiler error.
        Line 4 compiles fine because toString() is defined on the Object class and is therefore always available to call.

        Line 9 creates the Hello class with the generic type String.
        It also passes an int to the println() method, which gets autoboxed into an Integer.
        While the println() method takes a generic parameter of type T,
        it is not the same <T> defined for the class on line 1. Instead,
        it is a different T defined as part of the method declaration on line 5.
        Therefore, the String argument on line 9 applies only to the class.
        The method can actually take any object as a parameter including autoboxed primitives.
        Line 7 creates the Hello class with the generic type Object since no type is specified for that instance.
        It passes a boolean to println(), which gets autoboxed into a Boolean. The result is that hi-1hola-true is printed,
        making option B correct.

    /*
    A class cannot extend any interface,
    as a class can only extend other classes and interfaces can only extend other interfaces,
    making option A correct.
    Java enables only limited multiple inheritance with inheritances,
    making option B incorrect.
    True multiple inheritance would be if a class could extend multiple classes directly.
    Option C is incorrect, as interfaces are implicitly marked abstract.
    Option D is also incorrect,
    as interfaces do not contain constructors and do not participate in object initialization.
    Option E is correct, an interface can extend multiple interfaces.
    Option F is also correct, as abstract types cannot be instantiated.

        ToDoubleFunction<String> x, LongToDoubleFunction y, Consumer<Double> z

        Lines 6 and 7 both call the method applyAsDouble() rather than apply().
        This tells us that the answer is a primitive functional interface,
        ruling out options C and D.
        The primitive versions are correct with options E and F.
        Line 8 calls accept(), making it a consumer.
        Option A is the remaining correct answer.
